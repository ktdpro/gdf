Your dragon fruit just reached the top of the trellis — congrats! 🎉  
Now it’s time for its **first major prune**: the apical cut.

> One snip now sets the stage for years of structured, productive growth.

### ✂️ Step 1: Wait for the Right Height

<p align="center">

  <br/><em>Let the main stem grow a bit above the trellis first.</em>
</p>

Don’t cut too early. Wait until the stem extends **6–12 inches above** the top. This gives the plant room to arch and form a balanced canopy.

---

### ✂️ Step 2: Make the Cut

Use clean, sharp shears to snip the **top 1–2 inches** off the main growing stem.

  <br/><em>Yes, it feels wrong. But it’s so right.</em>
</p>

> This removes the **apical meristem**, which tells the plant to grow vertically.

Once removed, the plant shifts focus to **lateral branching**.

---

### ⏳ Step 3: Be Patient

Over the next few weeks, you’ll see new shoots emerge from the nodes below the cut.

> These will become your plant’s **fruiting arms**.

---

### 🌿 Step 4: Train the Canopy

Let the new branches grow and **select the strongest 3–5** to form your umbrella shape.

  <br/><em>The perfect shape for light, airflow, and fruit production.</em>
</p>

Once formed, maintain the shape with light seasonal pruning.

### Final Word

One simple cut changes everything.

✅ Better light distribution  
✅ Easier harvesting  
✅ Stronger, more productive branches

> Don’t be afraid to prune — it’s the secret to a long-lived, fruit-loaded dragon fruit plant.
