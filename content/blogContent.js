New growers, eager to nurture their new plant, often give it too much love in the form of water. But remember, this is a cactus! While it's a tropical cactus, it is extremely susceptible to root rot. Here are five key signs that you might be overdoing it with the watering can." } ] },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: [ { type: 'bold', content: "1. Yellowing Stems:" }, { type: 'text', content: " This is the most classic sign. When the soil is waterlogged, the roots can't breathe and begin to rot. The plant can no longer take up nutrients effectively, and the first place this shows is in the stems, which will turn from a vibrant green to a sickly yellow." } ] },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: [ { type: 'bold', content: "2. Mushy Base:" }, { type: 'text', content: " Gently squeeze the base of the plant near the soil line. It should be firm and solid. If it feels soft, mushy, or squishy, that's a very bad sign that rot has already set in at the roots and is moving up the main stem." } ] },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: [ { type: 'bold', content: "3. Stunted or No New Growth:" }, { type: 'text', content: " During the growing season, a healthy dragon fruit should be putting out new green shoots. If your plant seems stalled and hasn't grown in weeks, it could be because its roots are struggling in overly wet soil." } ] },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: [ { type: 'bold', content: "4. Fungus Gnats:" }, { type: 'text', content: " Do you see tiny, black flies hovering around the soil of your pot? These are fungus gnats, and they thrive in consistently moist soil. Their presence is a direct indicator that your soil isn't drying out properly between waterings." } ] },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: [ { type: 'bold', content: "5. Green Algae on Soil Surface:" }, { type: 'text', content: " If the top of your soil has a layer of green algae, it's a clear sign that the surface is staying wet for far too long. This creates a perfect environment for fungal diseases to take hold. The soil surface should be dry to the touch." } ] },

The answer is a qualified 'yes, but...'. It all comes down to the N-P-K numbers on the bag and the current life stage of your plant." } ] },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: [ { type: 'bold', content: "Most tomato fertilizers are formulated to support flowering and fruiting." }, { type: 'text', content: " This means they are typically higher in Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) and lower in Nitrogen (N). A common NPK ratio for a 'bloom' or 'tomato' food might be something like 5-10-10. This is actually very similar to the 'bloom booster' fertilizer we recommend for mature dragon fruit during their fruiting season." } ] },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: [ { type: 'bold', content: "When it's okay:" }, { type: 'text', content: " If you have a mature dragon fruit plant (at least 2-3 years old) and you want to encourage it to flower and produce fruit, using a tomato fertilizer during the spring and summer is generally fine. The low nitrogen won't push out excessive green growth, and the higher phosphorus and potassium will support flower and fruit development." } ] },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: [ { type: 'bold', content: "When it's a bad idea:" }, { type: 'text', content: " Do NOT use a low-nitrogen tomato fertilizer on a young, developing dragon fruit plant. During its first couple of years, a dragon fruit's primary goal is to grow strong, thick, green stems that will form the main structure of the plant. For this, it needs a balanced fertilizer with plenty of nitrogen, such as a 16-16-16 or 20-20-20. Using a tomato fertilizer on a young plant will starve it of the nitrogen it needs for this critical vegetative growth, resulting in a stunted and weak plant." } ] },
