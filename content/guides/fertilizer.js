The three numbers on a fertilizer bag, N-P-K, represent Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). Each plays a different role. <strong>Nitrogen (N)</strong> fuels green, leafy growth. <strong>Phosphorus (P)</strong> is crucial for root development and flowering. <strong>Potassium (K)</strong> supports overall plant function and fruit quality.", "During the plant's <strong>growth phase</strong> (when it's young or in early spring), use a balanced fertilizer like a 16-16-16 or a 20-20-20 to encourage strong, thick, green stems. Once the plant is mature and you want to encourage <strong>fruiting</strong>, switch to a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorus 'bloom booster' formula, like a 2-10-10 or 0-10-10. Giving a mature plant too much nitrogen will result in a beautiful, lush green plant with zero fruit."] },

The plant simply doesn't have the fuel to produce strong new stems. If you see these signs, it's time to adjust your feeding regimen."] },
